### HTML, Baby
<img src="https://after-school-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/html-baby.png" width="300px" align="right" hspace="10">**HTML** stands for **Hypertext Markup Language**, and every single website on the internet is written in HTML. Every. Single. Page. HTML provides the skeleton for websites and organizes the different elements on a page into categories like image, paragraph, and title. 

HTML has a specific syntax that's a bit different from Ruby, but you'll get a hang of it quickly. It's not too hard, at all. Most commonly, you'll write HTML in pairs of bracketed tags like this:
```html
<title> My Awesome Webpage </title>
```
